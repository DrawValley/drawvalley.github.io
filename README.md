# DrawValley

This is DrawValley.
A free open source software made for drawing during lessons, with distance learning and in presence on Whiteboards.
This software is made with only HTML and JavaScript, especially because you can use it directly from your browser, without any external library to have a light programme.
In future, once the sofware completed, I will insert the js code in an exe file, to a simple access with an application.
The final goal is made this programme the best software for techers at school, free and easy to use, on every platform from PC to Mobile on tablets.

The licence is free, if you're inserting this programme or some parts of code in your project or site please show credits with DrawValley's GitHub Page.
All the contributions are welcome.

This is my first experience on GitHub, i hope this project will have successs.
